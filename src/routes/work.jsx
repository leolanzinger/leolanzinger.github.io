                            <p>As Principal Product Designer, I was responsible for the customer experience of Zalando customers who shop and sell second-hand fashion, as well as the experience of customers using Zalando for recycling their old unwearable clothes.</p>
                            <p>Led projects include: leading user research to identify strategic opportunities in the overall customer journey, product design work on new second-hand reselling and recycling services and workshops facilitation.</p>

                            <p>Together with The Studio team, I explored different strategic topics including Zalandoâ€™s sustainability digital experience, connecting brick and mortar stores to the Zalando platform and visualising the partnership with Sephora and Nike.</p>
                            <p>Being a bit of a design process geek, I dived into design ops topics and managed the design community methods toolkit, designed the design system contribution model and developed a Figma plugin to help colleagues create prototypes faster. During a brief stint in the design system team, I also helped out as a front-end developer to develop the newly designed components.</p>

                            <p>As an interaction designer intern, I redesigned the sound recording tool used by language experts to record audio material for Babbel online language courses, integrating it in a git-based CAT tool.</p>
                            <p>As part of this internship, I wrote a thesis on the effect of a redesigned interfaces on its usability for users with different system experience and domain expertise.</p>
