            <p>
              I am a product designer with a passion for user research and design strategy.
              I work as a Principal Product Designer at Zalando Recommerce, designing experiences for people who buy and sell second-hand fashion.
            </p>
            <p>
              Previously, I was part of The Studio at Zalando, a design team with a focus on early stage ideas and strategic design propositions.
              I also worked for Babbel in Berlin and Belka in Trento, Italy.

            <h4>education + music</h4>
            <p>
              I have a bachelor degree in Computer Science and a master in Human-Computer Interaction Design.
              When I am not glued to Figma or running user interviews, I produce and record music with <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6M2Pk85GotQvfbYCmWhEme">Bob and the Apple</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/42MCPv6PC71ywUF6cR5uHU">Julia PÃ­gali</a>, playing the bass guitar and the synthesiser.
