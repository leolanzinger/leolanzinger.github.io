                        As the Senior Product Designer of the team, I am the responsible designer for the experience of Zalando customers who shop and sell second-hand fashion, as well as the experience of customers using Zalando for recycling their old unwearable clothes.

                    <date>2017 - 2021</date>
                    <p>
                        Together with The Studio team, I explored different strategic topics including Zalandoâ€™s sustainability digital experience, connecting brick and mortar stores to the Zalando platform and visualising the partnership with Sephora and Nike.<br />
                        Being a bit of a design process geek, I dived into design ops topics and managed the design community methods toolkit, designed the <a href="https://medium.com/zalando-design/zalandos-design-system-contribution-model-73ab36f8591e">design system contribution model</a> and developed a Figma plugin to help colleagues create prototypes faster.
                        During a brief stint in the design system team, I also helped out as a front-end developer.

                        As an interaction designer intern, my responsibility was to redesign the sound recording tool used by language experts to record audio material for Babbel online language courses.
